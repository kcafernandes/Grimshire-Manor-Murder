# Grimshire-Manor-Murder
A fully interactive terminal-based murder mystery game written in C++ for my CS100 final project. The game places the player inside Grimshire Manor, where they explore rooms, interrogate characters, gather clues, and uncover the truth behind a mysterious murder.  This project was built from scratch in Visual Studio
